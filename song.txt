I'm lying wide awake
My head spinning over you
Dark of night, no stars inside
You are dreaming next to me
Afraid to close my eyes,
â€˜cause I don't wanna miss a moment of you
Don't want to dream, no
No dream could be as beatiful as you are
Tell me what have I done to deserve something this beatiful

Tell me why
Am I the one your all belongs to- why me?
Tell me why
Am I the one you wanna place in your heart-why me?
Tell me why do you love me
Why is me you want?
